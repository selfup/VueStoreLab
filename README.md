# VueStoreLab

JavaScript State Tree Plugin for Vue!

**Example Repo with `vue-cli`:** https://github.com/selfup/vue-store-lab-example-repo

### Installation/Usage

This was built with modern build tools in mind.

Frontend assumptions are that you use a build tool:
1. Webpack
2. Grunt
3. Gulp

This is transpiled to ES5 from ES6 so any modern Node version will work :smile:

`npm install vue-store-lab --save`

### Exceptions

You might need a polyfill for `Object.assign` :joy:
